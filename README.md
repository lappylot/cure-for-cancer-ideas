Practical Use of These Equations

Design: Use the vaccine submodular objective (Sec. 1) to pick epitope panels that actually maximize subclone coverage under manufacturing limits.

Dosing: With CAR-T (Sec. 2) and bispecifics (Sec. 9), the systems show how to shape dosing to keep cytokines below thresholds while preserving killing.

Combo Strategy: Couple oncolytic virus spread (Sec. 7) with TME buffering (Sec. 10) to make tumors “hot” and center OV replication where immunity can finish the job.

Adaptive Control: The RL/MPC frame (Sec. 8) turns these mechanistic ODEs into a control problem that updates dosing from liquid biopsy signals (Sec. 5).

Resistance: Multi-target CRISPR (Sec. 3) and synthetic lethality scheduling (Sec. 6) raise the genetic barrier to escape.

If you want, I can package these as a single LaTeX note (with a small simulation in Python to demonstrate a multi-modal regimen), or expand any section into a more detailed derivation with parameter identifiability/estimation tips.

Here’s a deep, equation-forward treatment for items 11–21. For each, I give a compact physical/biological picture, governing equations (ODE/PDE/stochastic where useful), key assumptions, and how to use the math to design/optimize therapies. I reuse symbols when possible and define new ones inline.

How to Use These (practical notes)

Calibration: Start with priors for rates from literature, refine via patient-specific data (blood PK, DCE-MRI, ctDNA, PET). Bayesian filtering (EKF/UKF/particle filters) can infer latent states like 
𝐸
E, 
𝐿
L, 
𝑆
S, 
𝑚
𝑘
m
k
	​

.

Design Space Exploration: Use global sensitivity (Sobol/PRCC) to find the levers that matter (e.g., 
𝑘
bind
,
𝑘
int
k
bind
	​

,k
int
	​

 for NP-TDD; 
𝑅
0
R
0
	​

 for CSC). Target those with engineering (surface ligands, linker chemistry, dose timing).

Optimization: MPC or model-based RL can choose dosing schedules 
𝑢
(
𝑡
)
u(t) that balance efficacy/toxicity. Start with simplified ODEs; extend to PDEs if spatial heterogeneity matters (solid tumors, QD ablation, FUS-BBB).

Safety Envelopes: Include integrated constraints—cytokine bounds for ICI/bsAb, liver/spleen exposure for exosomes/NPs, edema limits for BBB-FUS, off-target occupancy for de-novo binders.

If you want, I can bundle these 11 sections into a LaTeX mini-monograph with a small Python notebook that simulates two or three combined modalities (e.g., NP-TDD + ICI + microbiome tuning) and shows how an MPC controller adjusts dosing from liquid-biopsy signals.

ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.
